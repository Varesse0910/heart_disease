# Let's try to predict CVD using GAM model and logistic regression


Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. More than 3 quarters of these deaths happen in poor countries.
However, it is possible to prevent most cardiovascular diseases by fighting some factors that are likely to cause them : tobacco, obesity, alcoholism or other diseases.
Four out of  five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. 
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease. The data used come from different datasets of different regions.
